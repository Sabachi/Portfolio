Ma's Business

Motivation:
While going through the SQL courses, there were many opportunities to practice queries. A sample of the practice queries is uploaded in the Assignment file. However, I could not find any opportunity to construct a Database (DB) from scratch. Constructing this database is an attempt to understand the complexities experienced while constructing the
DB for clients. 

Inspiration:
My mother's (hereafter mentioned as entrepreneur) former business of making and selling leather bags.

Scope:
Design a DB which provides an overview of the admnistration of an entrepreneur's former business.  

Business:
An entrepreneur has a business of designing, making and selling leather bags. The owner sells to wholesale organizations.
3 tailors, 3 sales agent and 1 marketing lead are on the payroll. The founder also works as a tailor. The business has 10 customers. 

Construction of the DB is WORK IN PROGRESS.
